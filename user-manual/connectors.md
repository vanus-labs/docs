Vanus Connect provides out-of-the-box Connectors that enable you to integrate with popular services or applications 
without writing codes. With a simple configuration file, Vanus Connectors connect to the external service and move data
in and out of that service on behalf of user applications, allowing you to focus on your business logic.
