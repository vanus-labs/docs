# Large Language Models

## What is Large Language Model?

A Large Language Model is **an artificial intelligence model that has been trained on a vast amount of text data**. The main goal of these models is to generate human-like text based on the input they are given. These models are capable of understanding context, making them highly versatile in multiple applications such as text generation, translation, question answering, and many more.


## What large language models does Vanus support?

Vanus AI currently supports the **ChatGPT3.5 and GPT-4** models developed by **Open AI**, as well as the **ERNIE Bot** developed by **Baidu**. At the same time, Vanus also integrates **Azure GPT-3.5** model based on ChatGPT3.5 adjustment and **ERNIE Bot Turbo** model based on ERNIE Bot adjustment.
  
In the future, Vanus AI is expected to connect to **more high-quality models** such as **Claude** developed by Anthropic and **Tongyi Qianwen** developed by Alibaba.

You can find all the large model options supported by Vanus AI when **creating an AI application**. 
  

### ChatGPT3.5

OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 is a premier language model proficient in various tasks, including **answering queries, conducting deep discussions, drafting emails, writing code, and generating written content**. It can also tutor on numerous subjects, translate languages, and simulate video game characters. Its versatility makes it practical for multiple fields.
  
The model's training involves **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**, allowing it to adapt and respond more specifically according to conversation context. Despite striving for accuracy, it's not advisable to rely exclusively on it for crucial decisions. **It can't access personal data unless shared during the conversation**, prompting users to exercise caution with sensitive information and to validate critical data provided by the model.

### Azure GPT-3.5

Azure GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-3.5 are **essentially the same** underlying model developed by OpenAI. The primary difference lies in **the platform or service offering through** which they are accessed.
  
Azure GPT-3.5 refers to the utilization of the model **through Microsoft's Azure cloud platform**. Microsoft has an exclusive license to ChatGPT3.5, so it offers the model's capabilities as part of its cloud services. Users of Azure can access GPT-3.5 for various tasks, including natural language understanding, text generation, and more, all **under the scalability and reliability of the Azure platform**. On the other hand, ChatGPT-3.5 refers to the model as accessed directly through OpenAI's API or its interactive web-based application.
  
In summary, the difference between Azure GPT-3.5 and OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 is mainly about **how and where you access the model**. **The underlying technology is the same**.

### GPT-4

GPT-4 is OpenAI’s **most advanced system**, producing **safer and more useful** responses. GPT-4 outperforms ChatGPT by scoring in higher approximate percentiles among test-takers. GPT-4 can solve difficult problems with greater accuracy, thanks to its broader general knowledge and problem solving abilities.
  
In terms of **creativity**, GPT-4 is more creative and collaborative than ever before. It can **generate, edit, and iterate** with users on creative and technical writing tasks, such as **composing songs, writing screenplays, or learning a user’s writing style**.
  
In terms of **visual input**, GPT-4 can accept images as inputs and generate **captions, classifications, and analyses**.
  
In terms of **longer text**, GPT-4 is capable of handling over **25,000 words** of text, allowing for use cases like long form **content creation, extended conversations, and document search and analysis**.

### ERNIE Bot

ERNIE Bot is the latest artificial intelligence technology developed by Baidu Inc. Capable of **interactive dialogues with individuals, answering questions, and assisting in content creation**. 

As a large pre-training language model based in the field of natural language processing, ERNIE Bot possesses a wide range of natural language processing capabilities, and can be applied in multiple fields including **text generation, text summarization, machine translation, and question answering systems**.
  
ERNIE Bot employs the latest deep learning technologies, including **Transformer and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM)** model structures. It undergoes training through a massive corpus, thereby possessing powerful language comprehension and generation capabilities. Additionally, ERNIE Bot has **multi-language support**, capable of handling a variety of natural languages, including Chinese and English.

### ERNIE Bot Turbo

ERNIE Bot and ERNIE Bot Turbo **are both** artificial intelligence language models **developed by Baidu**, with the ability to answer various questions and provide users with information and help. However, there are some **differences** between them:

-ERNIE Bot Turbo is **much faster** than ERNIE Bot in response and processing speed.  

-ERNIE Bot Turbo is **more accurate** than ERNIE Bot in answer content.
  
-ERNIE Bot Turbo has **stronger learning ability** and can **automatically update knowledge** after continuous learning, while ERNIE Bot needs to be updated through manual operations.
  
-ERNIE Bot Turbo supports **more usage methods**, which can meet users' different needs in **various scenarios**. ERNIE Bot is more suitable for fixed scenarios and fixed usage methods.
  

In general, **ERNIE Bot Turbo is more advanced than ERNIE Bot** in processing speed, answering accuracy, learning ability and usage method, but the two have certain application scenes. It depends on specific application needs.
  

## Which large model should I choose?

Vanus AI offers a variety of large models, each with its unique strengths and specific application scenarios. We encourage you to choose the most suitable model **based on your usage needs and actual test results**.
  
If you require **high-quality model response effects**, we highly recommend that you **prioritize the use of the GPT-4 model**. GPT-4 **outperforms other models** in terms of language skills, knowledge capacity, reasoning ability, and understanding ability. 

Therefore, in terms of pricing, **using other models for one dialogue consumes 1 credit, while using GPT-4 for one dialogue will consume 20 credits**. The superior performance and output results of GPT-4 are absolutely worth the price.
  
In summary, which model to choose **depends on your specific needs and the effects you expect**. We are always ready to assist you in making choices and ensure that you can get satisfactory results.
